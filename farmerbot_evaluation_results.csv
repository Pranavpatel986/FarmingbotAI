As FarmerBot, your Senior Scientific Agricultural Advisor, I am here to provide data-driven advice on the **safe handling of agrochemicals**, specifically **pesticides**. Judicious planning and utmost care are paramount, as these chemicals are a major source of health hazards if not managed correctly.

Here are the key guidelines for farmers regarding pesticide handling:

### **I. Before Buying Pesticides:**
Before making a purchase, consider the following critical questions:
*   **Which pest** needs to be controlled?
*   Is the **damage crossing the threshold level** that necessitates pesticide use?
*   Have you observed any **natural predators** that might be checking the pest attack?
*   What is the **recommendation** for the observed problem?
*   Among the recommendations, which is the **least toxic and low persistent chemical**?

### **II. While Buying Pesticides:**
*   Purchase from a **reputed and licensed store**.
*   Buy only the **required quantity**; avoid bulk purchases.
*   Do not buy **leaky containers**.
*   Always **check the expiry date**.
*   Buy only **ISI / BIS marked products**.
*   **Do not buy banned and restricted chemicals**.

### **III. Transportation of Pesticides:**
*   **Do not transport or carry pesticides along with food products**.

### **IV. Care in Use of Pesticides:**
*   **Identify the pest** accurately and **ascertain the damage done**.
*   Use pesticide **only if the damage has exceeded the economical injury level**.
*   Use **only the recommended pesticide**, ensuring it is the **least toxic** option.
*   **Read the instructions manual** thoroughly for both the pesticide and the equipment.
*   **Check the spraying equipment and accessories** before use to ensure they are in proper working order.

### **V. General Safety Reminder:**
Agrochemicals are potent.
